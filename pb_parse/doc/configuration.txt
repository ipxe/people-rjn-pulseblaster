The configuration of the pulseblaster is defined in pb_print_config (part of pb_utils, which contains pulseblaster.h.) 
A copy of that file is distributed with pb_parse, as doc/pulseblaster_h.txt (though this may not be correct for the hardware in use).
That file is well commented; look there!

The additional configuration specific to the parser is defined within the "Configuration Section" inside pb_parse.
