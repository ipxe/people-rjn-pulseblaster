The pulseblaster hardware has two restrictions on WAIT opcodes:

 a) WAIT may not be the first instruction.
 b) If WAIT is the 2nd instruction, the 1st instruction must have a length of at least 11 ticks.


The values are defined in ../../pb_utils/pulseblaster.h, via pb_print_config
For more details, read ../../pb_utils/doc/wait.txt .


Don't worry too much about this - the parser will catch this error.
