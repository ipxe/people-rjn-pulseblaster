/* Simple example of call and return */

/* Turn on LED_0  (1 sec)
   Turn on LED_7, (1 sec), then call sub1.
   Turn on LED_8  (1 sec),
   Turn on LED_15 (1 sec), then return
   Stop with all LEDs on.

Note that this conceptualises the call/return happening after the delay.
The Opcode really "executes, taking the length to do so." (the result is the same)
