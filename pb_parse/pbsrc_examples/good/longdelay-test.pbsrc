/*This is a test of the LONGDELAY opcode (and promoted/demoted conts). This program ought to:

   a) Output 0x1  	(1 LED),  for 5 seconds.
   b) Output 0x3  	(2 LEDs), for 10 seconds
   c) Output 0x7  	(3 LEDs), for 15 seconds
   d) Output 0xF  	(4 LEDs), for 1 minutes
   e) Output 0x1F 	(5 LEDs), for 2 minutes
   f) Output 0xFF 	(8 LEDs), for 6 minutes
   g) Output 0xFFFFFF	(24 LEDs),for over a year  (if you don't terminate it first!)
   h) Output 0x0  	(all off) and STOP.

		0x1		longdelay	1		5s		//1 LED,  5s. 	Longdelay - but will be automatically 'demoted' to Cont, since arg=1.

		0x7		longdelay	3		5s		//3 LEDs, 15s. 	Longdelay, specified in full.  [Aside: 3 is smallest value exceeding PB_BUG_LONGDELAY_OFFSET]

		0xf		longdelay	-		1min		//4 LEDs, 1min. Long delay, automatic calculation of ARG.

		0x1f		longdelay	auto		2min		//5 LEDs, 2min  Long delay, automatic calculation of ARG.  (auto makes this explicit)
