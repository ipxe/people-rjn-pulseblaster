/*This is a test of the LOOP and ENDLOOP opcodes, with NESTING. This program ought to

   b)Loop 4 times:
	i)Blink LED_7   3 times (quickly, first on, then off)
	ii)Wait 2 seconds (with it off).	#turning on LED_15 for debugging.
   c)ALL LEDs on (denote end of program) for 1 second, then
   d)GOTO start
