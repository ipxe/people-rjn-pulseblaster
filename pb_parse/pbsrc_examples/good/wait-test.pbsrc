/*This is a test of the WAIT opcode. This program ought to
   a)Output 0x1	  (1 LED) for 3 seconds
   b)Output 0xff  (8 LEDs), and then WAIT.
   c)On HW_TRIG, or running pb_cont, it should delay another 3 seconds.
   d)Output 0xffff (16 LEDs), for 3 seconds
   e)Output 0x0  (all off) and STOP. # NB overloaded stop opcode!

  Note that running pb_start will RE-start the device - not what is wanted!
