A .bin file is a raw pulseblaster-executable. This is compiled by pb_asm, and then
loaded into the physical pulseblaster by pb_prog (or directly writing it to the pulseblaster
interface within /sys). 

pb_prog can also skip this step and program a .vliw file.

The format of the .bin file is in raw.txt
