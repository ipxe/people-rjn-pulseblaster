HARDWARE MODIFICATION
---------------------

I modified the pulseblaster slightly, in order to improve it for our needs.
The board itself wasn't altered in any permanent way.

EXTERNAL INPUTS
---------------

Originally, HW_TRIG and HW_RESET are just exposed on JP100 headers. 
These are now brought out via a DE9 connector on the rear bracket.


SYNCHRONISED CLOCKS
-------------------

The PulseBlaster's clock is a 100 MHz oscillator in a DIL socket. But we need to ensure that the 100 MHz clock for the NI 4462 and the 100 MHz clock for
the PulseBlaster are always exactly in sync. The typical +/- 40ppm accuracy of the separate oscillators is not good enough.

Since the PB's oscillator is socketed and the NI's is soldered in, the NI 4462's 100 MHz clock is now exported (via LVDS, twisted pair and a FIN1001). 
The PB's 100 MHz oscillator is unplugged from the DIL socket, and a small receiver circuit (FIN1002 + buffer) is plugged in there instead. 
The two systems now share the same clock, without any drift.


TRIGGER DELAY
-------------

The HW trigger must actually be delayed slightly, as a workaround to the jitterinesss of the NI 4462. Since the 4462's trigger input has a jitter of ~ 5 us,
the NI 4462's (low-freq) sample clock is used to gate the PB's HW_Trigger. This means that HW trigger isn't exactly on time, but that PB programs always start
at a repeatable instant within the NI 4462's cycle; thus the PB+NI combined programs are repeatable without uncertainty.

SUMMARY: the PulseBlaster responds to the first Rising-Edge on RTSI6 that follows (at least 1us) after a Falling-edge on HW_Trigger (DE9), [provided Reset isn't also asserted.]

A 74VHC74 D-flip-flop is interposed between the External HW trigger and the actual one; it's clocked by the NI 4462 at ~200 kHz. The connections are:

	Gnd	to Ground [via JP100]
	+3V3    to 3v3 Supply [on PulseBlaster board]
	nR	to HW_Reset input [on DE9 connector], and to HW_Reset [on PulseBlaster JP100].	
	nS	to HW_Trig input  [on DE9 connector], with 10k pullup, via 1nF capacitor, and 1k pullup. [R-C-R is a pulse-shortening 1 us monostable]
	CK      to the NI 4462's RTSI6, with 100k pulldown. [This connector is named "JP77".]
	D	low.
	Q	to 7400 NOT gate input, via 1nF capacitor (and 1k pullup), forming another 1 us monostable. 

A 74VHC00 NAND chip is used to buffer the output of the monostable, and to ensure that when HW_Reset goes low, any stored clock-pulse does not get transferred to HWT:

	A1,B1	to 7474's Q, with pullup, via capacitor (see above).
	Q1	to A2.
	A2	to Q1
	B2	to nR, of 7474 above.
	Q2	to PulseBlaster's HW_Trigger [JP100].	

Note: 74VHC chips run on 3v3, but the inputs are 7V tolerant, so the 5V RTSI6 is fine, as is the brief positive spike from the RC monostable.

This means that:
        - the PB triggering is always synchronised with a (usually 5us) sample clock of the 4462.
        - the PB will NOT RESPOND to HW_TRIGGER except when the 4462 is running. Typically the 4462 should be started in "reference trigger" mode, so that
          the 7474 is receiving a constant stream of clock pulses, even when no acquisition is occurring.
	  [See also: pb_convey_hwtrigger, which does this. ]
	- A pending trigger (HWT without CK) will be "stored up", and sent to the PulseBlaster when the 4462 starts... this can be cleared by HW_Reset.
Also:
        - HW_Reset will always work (because of the 7474's nR being connected to it, forcing the D-type to reset, even if unclocked).
        - HW_Trigger can never be held low (because of the RC monostable), preventing artefacts when HWT is low and HWR rises.



SERIAL PORT ADAPTER
-------------------

A simple circuit is constructed to interface an RS232 serial port's RTS pin via an open-collector to the HW_trigger input.
The software is pb_serial_trigger(1). This is useful because, unlike pb_start (pure software trigger), this goes via the trigger-delay 7474.

Circuit design (assembled inside a DE9-F connector). RTS is the trigger; CTS is for readback.
The pullup to +5V is part of the driven circuit; this is shown for clarity only.
