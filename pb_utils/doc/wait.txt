INFORMATION
-----------

The pulseblaster hardware has two restrictions on WAIT opcodes:

 a) WAIT may not be the first instruction.
 b) If WAIT is the 2nd instruction, the 1st instruction must have a length of at least 11 ticks.


HARDWARE
--------

The actual limitations of the hardware are detailed in pulseblaster.h. These are the important parameters:

PB_BUG_WAIT_NOTFIRST  =  1

PB_BUG_WAIT_MINFIRSTDELAY = 11



ACTUALLY DOING IT
-----------------

These checks are both performed, both in pb_write_vliw() and pb_parse.
