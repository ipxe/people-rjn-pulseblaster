//Simple example of LONGDELAY. Note that the first LongDelay (with ARG 1) gets transparently demoted to CONT.

//OUTPUT	OPCODE 		ARG	LENGTH		//comment

0x00		cont		-	100000000	//all off 1 sec
0x01		cont		-	100000000	//bit 1 on 1 sec

0x80		longdelay	1	100000000	//bit 7 on. Short longdelay (demoted)
0xff00		longdelay	5	100000000	//bits 15,8 on. Longdelay: 5 seconds.

0xffff		goto		0	200000000	//all on 2 sec. goto start.
