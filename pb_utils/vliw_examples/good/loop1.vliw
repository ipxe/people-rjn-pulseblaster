//Simple example of a loop/endloop.
//Loop with ARG = 1 means "straight though once".

//So the Endloop doesn't actually jump back.

//OUTPUT	OPCODE 		ARG	LENGTH		//comment

0x00		cont		-	100000000	//all off 1 sec
0x01		cont		-	100000000	//bit 1 on 1 sec

0x80		loop		1	100000000	//bit 7 on. wait 1 sec. Start 3 loops
0x0100		endloop		2	100000000	//bit 8 on. wait 1 sec. Endloop or continue.

0xffff		goto		0	200000000	//all on 2 sec. goto start.
